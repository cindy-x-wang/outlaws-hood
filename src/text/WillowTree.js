The knaves dropped to their knees, crying: “The master is no ordinary mortal! He's truly one of the Lohans! If he didn't have ten million catties of strength, how could he have uprooted that tree?”

“It was nothing at all,” Lu said. “One of these days I'll show you how to handle weapons.”

That night the vagabonds departed. But they came again the next day, and every day thereafter, bringing meat and wine to feast Sagacious, for they positively worshipped him. They begged the monk to demonstrate his skill with weapons.

After several days of this, Sagacious thought to himself: “These fellows have been treating me day after day. I ought to give them a banquet in return.” He sent a few lay brothers into the city to buy several platters of fruit and five or six buckets of wine, and he killed a pig and slaughtered a sheep. It was then the end of the third lunar month.

“The weather's getting warm,” said Sagacious. He had mats spread beneath the green ash tree and invited the rascals to sit around and feast outdoors.

Wine was served in large bowls and meat in big chunks. When everyone had eaten his fill, the fruit was brought out and more wine. Soon the feasters were thoroughly sated.

"Then have I gained this day," quoth Robin, "the three stoutest yeomen in all Nottinghamshire. We will get us away to the greenwood tree, and there hold a merry feast in honor of our new friends, and mayhap a cup or two of good sack and canary may mellow the soreness of my poor joints and bones, though I warrant it will be many a day before I am again the man I was." So saying, he turned and led the way, the rest following, and so they entered the forest once more and were lost to sight.

So that night all was ablaze with crackling fires in the woodlands, for though Robin and those others spoken of, only excepting Midge, the Miller's son, had many a sore bump and bruise here and there on their bodies, they were still not so sore in the joints that they could not enjoy a jolly feast given all in welcome to the new members of the band. Thus with songs and jesting and laughter that echoed through the deeper and more silent nooks of the forest, the night passed quickly along, as such merry times are wont to do, until at last each man sought his couch and silence fell on all things and all things seemed to sleep.
