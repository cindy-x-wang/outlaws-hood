Robin called the band around him and spoke to them thus:

"Now let us get straightway into Nottingham Town and mix ourselves with the people there; but keep ye one another in sight, pressing as near the prisoner and his guards as ye can, when they come outside the walls. Strike no man without need, for I would fain avoid bloodshed, but if ye do strike, strike hard, and see that there be no need to strike again. Then keep all together until we come again to Sherwood, and let no man leave his fellows."

The sun was low in the western sky when a bugle note sounded from the castle wall. Then all was bustle in Nottingham Town and crowds filled the streets, for all knew that the famous Will Stutely was to be hanged that day. Presently the castle gates opened wide and a great array of men-at-arms came forth with noise and clatter, the Sheriff, all clad in shining mail of linked chain, riding at their head. In the midst of all the guard, in a cart, with a halter about his neck, rode Will Stutely. His face was pale with his wound and with loss of blood, like the moon in broad daylight, and his fair hair was clotted in points upon his forehead, where the blood had hardened. When he came forth from the castle he looked up and he looked down, but though he saw some faces that showed pity and some that showed friendliness, he saw none that he knew.

At last they came to the great town gate, through which Stutely saw the fair country beyond, with hills and dales all clothed in verdure, and far away the dusky line of Sherwood's skirts. Then when he saw the slanting sunlight lying on field and fallow, shining redly here and there on cot and farmhouse, and when he heard the sweet birds singing their vespers, and the sheep bleating upon the hillside, and beheld the swallows flying in the bright air, there came a great fullness to his heart so that all things blurred to his sight through salt tears, and he bowed his head lest the folk should think him unmanly when they saw the tears in his eyes. Thus he kept his head bowed till they had passed through the gate and were outside the walls of the town. But when he looked up again he felt his heart leap within him and then stand still for pure joy, for he saw the face of one of his own dear companions of merry Sherwood; then glancing quickly around he saw well-known faces upon all sides of him, crowding closely upon the men-at-arms who were guarding him. Then of a sudden the blood sprang to his cheeks, for he saw for a moment his own good master in the press and, seeing him, knew that Robin Hood and all his band were there. Yet betwixt him and them was a line of men-at-arms.

"Now, stand back!" cried the Sheriff in a mighty voice, for the crowd pressed around on all sides. "What mean ye, varlets, that ye push upon us so? Stand back, I say!"

Then came a bustle and a noise, and one strove to push between the men-at-arms so as to reach the cart, and Stutely saw that it was Little John that made all that stir.

"Now stand thou back!" cried one of the men-at-arms whom Little John pushed with his elbows.

"Now stand thou back thine own self," quoth Little John, and straightway smote the man a buffet beside his head that felled him as a butcher fells an ox, and then he leaped to the cart where Stutely sat.

"I pray thee take leave of thy friends ere thou diest, Will," quoth he, "or maybe I will die with thee if thou must die, for I could never have better company." Then with one stroke he cut the bonds that bound the other's arms and legs, and Stutely leaped straightway from the cart.

"Now as I live," cried the Sheriff, "yon varlet I know right well is a sturdy rebel! Take him, I bid you all, and let him not go!"

So saying, he spurred his horse upon Little John, and rising in his stirrups smote with might and main, but Little John ducked quickly underneath the horse's belly and the blow whistled harmlessly over his head.

"Nay, good Sir Sheriff," cried he, leaping up again when the blow had passed, "I must e'en borrow thy most worshipful sword." Thereupon he twitched the weapon deftly from out the Sheriff's hand, "Here, Stutely," he cried, "the Sheriff hath lent thee his sword! Back to back with me, man, and defend thyself, for help is nigh!"

"Down with them!" bellowed the Sheriff in a voice like an angry bull; and he spurred his horse upon the two who now stood back to back, forgetting in his rage that he had no weapon with which to defend himself.

"Stand back, Sheriff!" cried Little John; and even as he spoke, a bugle horn sounded shrilly and a clothyard shaft whistled within an inch of the Sheriff's head. Then came a swaying hither and thither, and oaths, cries, and groans, and clashing of steel, and swords flashed in the setting sun, and a score of arrows whistled through the air. And some cried, "Help, help!" and some, "A rescue, a rescue!"

"Treason!" cried the Sheriff in a loud voice. "Bear back! Bear back! Else we be all dead men!" Thereupon he reined his horse backward through the thickest of the crowd.

Now Robin Hood and his band might have slain half of the Sheriff's men had they desired to do so, but they let them push out of the press and get them gone, only sending a bunch of arrows after them to hurry them in their flight.

"Oh stay!" shouted Will Stutely after the Sheriff. "Thou wilt never catch bold Robin Hood if thou dost not stand to meet him face to face." But the Sheriff, bowing along his horse's back, made no answer but only spurred the faster.

Then Will Stutely turned to Little John and looked him in the face till the tears ran down from his eyes and he wept aloud; and kissing his friend's cheeks, "O Little John!" quoth he, "mine own true friend, and he that I love better than man or woman in all the world beside! Little did I reckon to see thy face this day, or to meet thee this side Paradise." Little John could make no answer, but wept also.

Then Robin Hood gathered his band together in a close rank, with Will Stutely in the midst, and thus they moved slowly away toward Sherwood, and were gone, as a storm cloud moves away from the spot where a tempest has swept the land. But they left ten of the Sheriff's men lying along the ground wounded—some more, some less—yet no one knew who smote them down.

Thus the Sheriff of Nottingham tried thrice to take Robin Hood and failed each time; and the last time he was frightened, for he felt how near he had come to losing his life; so he said, "These men fear neither God nor man, nor king nor king's officers. I would sooner lose mine office than my life, so I will trouble them no more." So he kept close within his castle for many a day and dared not show his face outside of his own household, and all the time he was gloomy and would speak to no one, for he was ashamed of what had happened that day.

“Chao Gai's manor is just ahead,” said Zhu Tong. “There are roads leading from both its front and rear gates. If we attack from the front, he'll leave by the rear. If we attack from the rear, he'll escape through the front. We must bear in mind that Chao Gai is a remarkable man. We don't know who those other six are, but they're certainly not kindly gentlemen, and they're all desperate. If they decide to fight their way out, with their vassals helping, we'll never be able to stop them. Our only hope is to shout from one direction and attack from another, get them running around in confusion, then make our move.
“I propose that we divide our forces into two groups, with me taking one half and Constable Lei taking the other. I will go quietly with my men, on foot, to the rear gate, and lay an ambush. When you hear us whistle, Constable Lei, you and your group smash in through the front gate. Arrest every man you can lay your hands on.”
“That sounds all right,” said Lei. “Only, wouldn't it be better if you and the sheriff struck from the front gate while I cut off the rear?”
“You don't understand, brother. There are three possible escape routes from the manor. I've observed them often. I know every path. Even without torches, I could follow them in the dark. You're not familiar with all the places Chao Gai could twist in and out of. If he gets away it'll be no joke.”
“You're right, Constable Zhu,” said the sheriff. “Take half the men.”
“I'll only need about thirty,” said Zhu Tong. He picked ten archers and twenty soldiers and departed.
The sheriff again climbed into his saddle, and Lei Heng placed a protective cordon of mounted archers around him. The soldiers were ranged in front. In the light of thirty or so torches, with tined−spears and halberds and hooks, they advanced rapidly in a body towards the manor.
When only half a li away, suddenly they saw fire rising from the central building, spreading a thick pall of back smoke and spewing red flames into the sky. Another ten paces and they saw thirty or forty more blazes springing up everywhere around the front and rear gates.
Lei Heng waved his halberd, the soldiers behind him shouted, and they broke through the front gate in a body. Inside, the fires had turned the manor bright as day, but the attackers didn't see a single person. Then, from the rear of the manor they heard yells and shouts, and cries of “Grab them!”
Actually, it had been Zhu Tong's intention from the start to let Chao Gai escape through the rear, and so he told Lei Heng to attack from the front. Lei Heng had the same idea. He too wanted to cover the rear gate and let Chao Gai flee. He had no choice when Zhu Tong insisted that he make a frontal assault, but he only put on a show, creating a lot of noise and running about with the aim of hastening the ward chief's get−away.
By the time Zhu Tong arrived at the rear gate Chao Gai had not yet finished putting his affairs in order. Vassals hastened to report: “The soldiers have come! We must hurry!” Chao Gai ordered them to set fire to the manor. He and Gongsun the Taoist priest, at the head of a dozen or so vassals, brandishing their halberds, dashed through the rear gate. “Try to stop us and die, get out of our way and live!” they shouted.
“Halt, Ward Chief,” Zhu Tong called from the shadows. “I've been waiting here for you a long time!”
Chao Gai paid no attention. He and Gongsun continued slashing furiously with their halberds. Pretending to dodge, Zhu Tong left a hole in the besiegers' line. The ward chief sent Gongsun and the vassals plunging through, and then followed, protecting their rear.
Zhu Tong pulled his foot archers from the manor's rear gate.
“There are robbers ahead, catch them!” he yelled. Lei Heng, hearing his shouts, came out of the front gate and also ordered his mounted and foot archers to give chase in various directions. He himself rushed about in the light of the fires, pretending to seek the fugitives.
Zhu Tong got away from his men and ran after Chao Gai, halberd in hand.
“Why are you chasing me, Constable Zhu?” the ward chief called over his shoulder. “I've done no wrong.”
Zhu Tong saw there was no one behind him, and he dared to speak freely. “You don't know what I've done for you, Ward Chief, I was afraid Lei Heng would get muddled and not treat you right. So I fooled him into raiding your front gate, while I waited at the rear to ensure your escape. Didn't you see that big breach I just made for you? Liangshan Marsh is your only safe refuge. Don't try any other place.”
“I'm deeply grateful to you for rescuing us. Some day I'll repay you.”
Behind them came the sound of Lei Heng shouting: “Don't let them get away!”
“There's nothing to be alarmed about,” Zhu Tong said to the ward chief. “Keep going. I'll draw them off.” He called back. “Three robbers are heading for the east path! After them, Constable Lei!”
Lei Heng and his men hurried east, followed by the soldiers. Zhu Tong continued talking with Chao Gai while feigning to pursue him. The fact is he was protecting the ward chief and seeing him on his way. Chao Gai finally vanished into the night. Zhu Tong pretended to trip. He fell heavily to the ground. The soldiers caught up and raised him to his feet.
“I couldn't see the path in the darkness. I ran off into the fields by mistake,” said Zhu Tong. “I slipped and fell. My right ankle is sprained.”
“The main culprit got away,” said the sheriff. “A pretty kettle of fish!”
“It isn't that I didn't try, but there isn't much I can do in the dark of the moon,” said Zhu Tong. “Most of these soldiers are useless. They're afraid to go after the robbers.”
The sheriff ordered the soldiers to continue the chase. But the soldiers thought: “Those two constables weren't any use themselves. If they couldn't get close, what good can we do?” They made a desultory show of pursuit, then came back and reported: “In this darkness we can't find which path they've taken.”
Lei Heng also returned after running a while. “Zhu Tong and Chao Gai are close friends,” he said to himself. “He's probably let him escape. I have no reason to harm him. I also wanted to let him go. Well, now he's gone, before I could prove my good intentions.”
“We hadn't a chance of catching them,” he said to the sheriff. “Those robbers are fantastic!”
It was already the fourth watch by the time the sheriff and the two constables reached the front of the manor. Inspector Ho observed the soldiers straggling in. After hunting all night they hadn't nabbed a single robber.
He groaned. “What am I going to tell the Jizhou prefect?”
All the sheriff could do was to seize a few of the ward chief's neighbors and take them back to Yuncheng County.

## Little John Helps Will Stutely Flee
