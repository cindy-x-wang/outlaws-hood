## How To Use This Site

Welcome! I invite you to explore this site and its comparisons of excerpts from _Outlaws of the Marsh_ and _The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood._ Both novels are very well-known and have remained popular through the test of time, and they noticeably share many similarities. By comparing various sections from the texts, the similarities are apparent, but the differences in Western and Chinese culture, particularly surrounding masculinity, are revealed.

The novels share the concept of _xia_ (侠), or knight-errant. The term knight-errant refers to a wandering knight who travels in search of adventure, much like the _youxia_ (游侠), who is a travelling warrior fighting for those who can’t defend themselves. _Outlaws of the Marsh_, includes the stories of multiple characters who travel and undertake adventures on their path to becoming the bandits at Liangshan. _The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood_ is structured in a very similar manner, but following the adventures of Robin Hood as he becomes a heroic outlaw, who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, instead of more than one protagonist.

This format aims to highlight the broad similarities in these novels, which makes it possible to rewrite each excerpt using text from the other novel. It also brings out differences in characterization and tone, which point to specific differences in Western and Chinese conceptions about masculinity.


## Chinese Masculinity: _wen_ and _wu_

A better paradigm to analyze Chinese masculinity with would be the binary opposition between _wen_ (文), the cultural and civil, and _wu_ (武), the physical or martial. The two masculine archetypes of _wen_ and _wu_ are the scholar and soldier respectively. Chinese masculinity actually comprises of both, and the scholar is in fact no less masculine than the soldier. There have been shifts in the ideals of masculinity and masculine beauty over the dynasties. For example, men during the Tang period cultivated a martial appearance, with thick beards, and admired bodily strength, with civilian and military officials practicing sword fighting and riding. But under Manchu occupation, martial strength became associated with the conquerors, and within the Chinese literary class the ideal lover became one who has a quiet scholarly demeanor.

_Wen_ and _wu_ refer specifically to the ancient Kings of the Zhou: King Wen and King Wu. The Book of Rites describes their differences in ruling style, saying that King Wen used culture to rule and King Wu used military power. While the two form a dichotomy, they were not in competition. It is beneficial to possess qualities of both _wen_ and _wu_; many emperors strove to show their subjects that they did in fact have both.
