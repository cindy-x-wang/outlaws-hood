It was at the dawn of day in the merry Maytime, when hedgerows are green and flowers bedeck the meadows; daisies pied and yellow cuckoo buds and fair primroses all along the briery hedges; when apple buds blossom and sweet birds sing, the lark at dawn of day, the throstle cock and cuckoo; when lads and lasses look upon each other with sweet thoughts; when busy housewives spread their linen to bleach upon the bright green grass. Sweet was the greenwood as he walked along its paths, and bright the green and rustling leaves, amid which the little birds sang with might and main: and blithely Robin whistled as he trudged along, thinking of Maid Marian and her bright eyes, for at such times a youth's thoughts are wont to turn pleasantly upon the lass that he loves the best.

As thus he walked along with a brisk step and a merry whistle, he came suddenly upon some foresters seated beneath a great oak tree. Fifteen there were in all, making themselves merry with feasting and drinking as they sat around a huge pasty, to which each man helped himself, thrusting his hands into the pie, and washing down that which they ate with great horns of ale which they drew all foaming from a barrel that stood nigh. Each man was clad in Lincoln green, and a fine show they made, seated upon the sward beneath that fair, spreading tree. Then one of them, with his mouth full, called out to Robin, "Hulloa, where goest thou, little lad, with thy one-penny bow and thy farthing shafts?"

Then Robin grew angry, for no stripling likes to be taunted with his green years.

"Now," quoth he, "my bow and eke mine arrows are as good as shine; and moreover, I go to the shooting match at Nottingham Town, which same has been proclaimed by our good Sheriff of Nottinghamshire; there I will shoot with other stout yeomen, for a prize has been offered of a fine butt of ale."

Then one who held a horn of ale in his hand said, "Ho! listen to the lad! Why, boy, thy mother's milk is yet scarce dry upon thy lips, and yet thou pratest of standing up with good stout men at Nottingham butts, thou who art scarce able to draw one string of a two-stone bow."

"I'll hold the best of you twenty marks," quoth bold Robin, "that I hit the clout at threescore rods, by the good help of Our Lady fair."

At this all laughed aloud, and one said, "Well boasted, thou fair infant, well boasted! And well thou knowest that no target is nigh to make good thy wager."

And another cried, "He will be taking ale with his milk next."

At this Robin grew right mad. "Hark ye," said he, "yonder, at the glade's end, I see a herd of deer, even more than threescore rods distant. I'll hold you twenty marks that, by leave of Our Lady, I cause the best hart among them to die."

"Now done!" cried he who had spoken first. "And here are twenty marks. I wager that thou causest no beast to die, with or without the aid of Our Lady."

Then Robin took his good yew bow in his hand, and placing the tip at his instep, he strung it right deftly; then he nocked a broad clothyard arrow and, raising the bow, drew the gray goose feather to his ear; the next moment the bowstring rang and the arrow sped down the glade as a sparrowhawk skims in a northern wind. High leaped the noblest hart of all the herd, only to fall dead, reddening the green path with his heart's blood.

"Ha!" cried Robin, "how likest thou that shot, good fellow? I wot the wager were mine, an it were three hundred pounds."

Then all the foresters were filled with rage, and he who had spoken the first and had lost the wager was more angry than all.

"Nay," cried he, "the wager is none of thine, and get thee gone, straightway, or, by all the saints of heaven, I'll baste thy sides until thou wilt ne'er be able to walk again." "Knowest thou not," said another, "that thou hast killed the King's deer, and, by the laws of our gracious lord and sovereign King Harry, thine ears should be shaven close to thy head?"

"Catch him!" cried a third.

"Nay," said a fourth, "let him e'en go because of his tender years."

Never a word said Robin Hood, but he looked at the foresters with a grim face; then, turning on his heel, strode away from them down the forest glade. But his heart was bitterly angry, for his blood was hot and youthful and prone to boil.

Now, well would it have been for him who had first spoken had he left Robin Hood alone; but his anger was hot, both because the youth had gotten the better of him and because of the deep draughts of ale that he had been quaffing. So, of a sudden, without any warning, he sprang to his feet, and seized upon his bow and fitted it to a shaft. "Ay," cried he, "and I'll hurry thee anon." And he sent the arrow whistling after Robin.

It was well for Robin Hood that that same forester's head was spinning with ale, or else he would never have taken another step. As it was, the arrow whistled within three inches of his head. Then he turned around and quickly drew his own bow, and sent an arrow back in return.

"Ye said I was no archer," cried he aloud, "but say so now again!"

The shaft flew straight; the archer fell forward with a cry, and lay on his face upon the ground, his arrows rattling about him from out of his quiver, the gray goose shaft wet with his; heart's blood. Then, before the others could gather their wits about them, Robin Hood was gone into the depths of the greenwood. Some started after him, but not with much heart, for each feared to suffer the death of his fellow; so presently they all came and lifted the dead man up and bore him away to Nottingham Town.

Meanwhile Robin Hood ran through the greenwood. Gone was all the joy and brightness from everything, for his heart was sick within him, and it was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man.

"Alas!" cried he, "thou hast found me an archer that will make thy wife to wring! I would that thou hadst ne'er said one word to me, or that I had never passed thy way, or e'en that my right forefinger had been stricken off ere that this had happened! In haste I smote, but grieve I sore at leisure!" And then, even in his trouble, he remembered the old saw that "What is done is done; and the egg cracked cannot be cured."

And so he came to dwell in the greenwood that was to be his home for many a year to come, never again to see the happy days with the lads and lasses of sweet Locksley Town; for he was outlawed, not only because he had killed a man, but also because he had poached upon the King's deer, and two hundred pounds were set upon his head, as a reward for whoever would bring him to the court of the King.

In a few minutes the waiter returned with a girl of about eighteen, followed by a man in his late fifties. Both carried wooden clappers. Though not very pretty, the girl was rather appealing. Wiping her eyes, she made three curtsies. The old man also greeted the diners.
“Where are you from?” asked Lu Da. “Why do you weep?”
“I will tell you our story, sir,” the girl replied. “We are from the Eastern Capital. My parents and I came to visit a relative, but when we arrived we learned he had left Weizhou for the Southern Capital. My mother fell ill in the inn and died. My father and I were having a hard time. Master Zheng, who is called the Lord of the West, saw me and wanted me for a concubine. He sent people to wheedle and threaten, and finally signed a contract promising my father three thousand strings of cash for me.”
“The contract was real but the promise was false. In less than three months his wife, a hard woman, drove me out of the house. What's more, Master Zheng ordered the innkeeper to demand that we 'return' his three thousand strings of cash. We never received a penny of his money. How could we repay him? My father is weak. He couldn't argue with a rich and powerful man like Zheng. We didn't know what to do. My father taught me many ballads when I was a child and we began making rounds of the taverns, singing. We give Zheng most of what little we earned each day, saving a little for our travelling expenses so that we can go home.
“But the last few days the taverns haven't had much business, so we couldn't pay. We're afraid Zheng will come asking for it and abuse us. Ours is a hard lot, and we've no place to seek redress. That's why we've been weeping. We hadn't meant to disturb you, sir. Please forgive us.”
“What's your family name?” asked Lu Da. “Which inn are you staying at? Where does Master Zheng, that Lord of the West, live?”
The old man replied: “Our name is Jin. I am the second among my brothers. My daughter is called Jade Lotus. Master Zheng is the butcher who sells meat at the foot of Zhuangyuan Bridge. His nickname is Lord of the West. My daughter and I live in the Lu Family Inn just up ahead inside the town's East Gate.”
“Bah,” said Lu Da contemptuously. “So Master Zheng is only Zheng the pig−sticker, the dirty rogue who runs a butcher shop under the patronage of Young General Zhong, our garrison commander. And he cheats and bullies too, does he?”
He turned to Li Zhong and Shi Jin. “You two wait here while I beat the varlet to death. I'll be right back.”
They grabbed him. “Calm yourself, brother,” they pleaded. “Let's talk this over again later.” They finally managed to restrain him.
“Come here, old man,” Lu Da said to the father. “I'll give you some money. Tomorrow you can go back to the Eastern Capital. How about it?” 
<center>…</center>
Old Jin summoned his daughter and raised his carrying−pole to his shoulder. He thanked Lu Da and started for the inn gate. The attendant stopped him.
“Where are you going, Uncle Jin?”
“Does he owe you any rent?” Lu Da demanded.
“He paid up last night. But Master Zheng has ordered me to collect the money he laid out for Jin's daughter.” “I'll return the butcher's money in person. Let the old man go.”
The attendant refused. Lu Da slapped him across the face with such force that blood gushed from his mouth. The punch that followed knocked out two of his front teeth. Crawling to his feet, the attendant scuttled to the interior of the inn and hid himself.
Of course the innkeeper dared not intervene.
Jin and his daughter quickly departed from the inn, then left the town to get the cart the old man had hired the day before.
Lu Da, afraid the attendant might still try to stop them, sat himself down on a stool in the inn and remained there for four hours. Only when he was confident that the old man was far away did he leave the inn. He went directly to the Zhuangyuan Bridge.
There Zheng had a two−room butcher shop with two chopping blocks. Four or five sides of pork were hanging on display. Zheng sat behind a counter by the door, keeping an eye on his ten or so assistants as they cut and sold meat.

<center>…</center>
Zheng laughed awkwardly. “Are you making fun of me?”
Lu Da leaped up, one package of chopped meat in each hand, and scowled at the butcher. “That's exactly what I'm doing—making fun of you.” He flung the contents of the packages full in Zheng's face.
The shower of meat stung the butcher into a rage. From the soles of his feet, fury surged into his forehead. An irrepressible flame blazed in his heart. He grabbed a paring knife from the butcher's block and jumped down from the shop steps. Lu Da was waiting for him in the middle of the street.
None of the dozen or so clerks from the neighboring shops dared to mediate. Passers−by stood frozen in their tracks on both sides of the street. The attendant from the inn was struck dumb.
The knife in his right hand, Zheng reached for Lu Da with his left. Lu Da seized the outstretched hand, closed in and sent the butcher sprawling with a swift kick in the groin. Another step forward and he put his foot on Zheng's chest. Raising a fist like a vinegar keg, Lu Da thundered: “I was roving inspector of five western military districts under Old General Zhong. People might very well call me Lord of the West. But you're just a meat slicing butcher, a low cur. Where do you come off giving yourself such a title? And who gave you the right to force and cheat Jin's daughter Jade Lotus?”
He landed a punch on Zheng's nose that flattened it to one side and brought the blood flowing like the sauces in a condiments shop— salty, sour and spicy. Zheng struggled vainly to rise. The knife fell from his hand. “A good blow,” he cried.
“Mother−raping thief,” said the major. “How dare you talk back?” He punched the butcher on the eyebrow, splitting the lid so that the eyeball protruded. Red, black and purple gore flowed like swatches of cloth in a draper's shop.
The spectators were all afraid of Lu Da. None of them ventured to intervene.
Vanquished, Zheng begged to be spared.
“You scurvy knave,” the major exclaimed scornfully. “If you had shown any guts I might have let you off. But since you're so lily−livered, I won't.” He struck the butcher a heavy blow on the temple. Zheng's head rang like the clanging of gongs, bells and cymbals in a big memorial service. The butcher lay stretched on the ground. Breath was coming out of his mouth, but none was going in. He didn't move.
Lu Da pretended to he incensed. “Playing dead, eh? I'll hit you a few more!” He had observed that Zheng's face was changing color. “I only wanted to give the varlet a beating,” he said to himself. “Who would have thought that three blows would kill him? They're sure to hold me for trial, and I've nobody to bring me food in prison. I'd better get out of here.”
He rose and strode away, pausing briefly to look back, shake his finger at Zheng's corpse and shout: “Go on playing dead. I'll settle with you later.”

**Zheng recognized him. He came out rapidly from behind the counter and greeted him with respect. “Major, a pleasure.” He directed an assistant to bring a bench. “Please be seated, sir."**

**Lu Da sat down. “The garrison commander has ordered me to buy ten catties of lean meat, chopped fine, to be used for filling. There mustn't be a speck of fat in it.”**

**“Right,” said Zheng. He turned to his assistants. “Pick out a good cut and chop up ten catties.”**

**“I don't want those dirty oafs touching it,” said Lu Da. “You do it yourself.”**

**“Certainly,” said Zheng. “Glad to.” He selected a cut of ten catties of lean meat and started mincing.**

<center>…</center>

**After chopping for an hour, Zheng wrapped the minced meat in a lotus leaf. “Shall I have it delivered, sir?” he asked.**

**“Delivered, nothing. What's your hurry? Now cut up ten catties of fat meat. There mustn't be a speck of lean in it. This is also for filling.”**

**“The lean can be put in dumplings, but what good is the fat?”**

**Lu Da glared. “When the commander gives an order, who dares question him?”**

**“As long as you can use it I'll chop it for you.” Zheng selected a cut of ten catties of fat meat and began mincing. By the time he wrapped it in a lotus leaf the morning had gone and it was the hour for lunch.**

<center>…</center>

**“Now I want ten catties of gristle, chopped fine, also to be used for filling, and I don't want to see any meat in it.”** 

**Zheng laughed awkwardly. “Are you making fun of me?”**

**Lu Da leaped up, one package of chopped meat in each hand, and scowled at the butcher. “That's exactly what I'm doing—making fun of you.” He flung the contents of the packages full in Zheng's face.**
